Welcome to the shady and shifty world of high finance. If you are here its probably because you have had the unfortunate experience of having your mortgage sold to BSI Financial.  BSI Financial is a predatory mortgage servicing company that is in the business of making people homeless.  

You might have  thought a 30 year mortgage is a 30 year mortgage.  Why should it change servicing companies each year? It is called Errors and Omissions fraud in the insurance sector. Also known as Escrow Oopsie. Businesses such as BSI Financial attempt to profit from the difference in Treasury yields on short term lending versus long term lending. They privatize profits and socialize their losses with insurance claims to FHA and the VA. BSI Financial has been cited several times for this practice.  In fact, Plaza Home Mortgage and other lenders that pass the ball to BSI are all represented by one law firm that continues to profiteer from making people homeless. Its estiomated that 3/5 homeless Americans were made so by McCarthy and Holthus LLP.

### Escrow Oopsie

When a mortgage servicing company  accepts your loan, what is in it for them?  Well very little unless you default.  So the incentive is all theirs to force you into default.  You may be confused why BSI Financial has decided to stop accepting your payments.

Well it is because their law firm and their financial clients make big profits purchasing your home in foreclosure.  They are not in the business of servicing loans.  They are in the business of making money.  And they make money by making you homeless.

### Business valuation

The five most common ways to value a business are

* asset valuation,
* historical earnings valuation,
* future maintainable earnings valuation,
* relative valuation (comparable company and comparable transactions),
* discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation

Professionals who value businesses generally do not use just one of these methods but a combination of some of them, as well as possibly others that are not mentioned above, in order to obtain a more accurate value. The information in the balance sheet or income statement is obtained by one of three accounting measures: a Notice to Reader, a Review Engagement or an Audit.

As synergy plays a large role in the valuation of acquisitions, it is paramount to get the value of synergies right. Synergies are different from the "sales price" valuation of the firm, as they will accrue to the buyer. Hence, the analysis should be done from the acquiring firm's point of view. Synergy-creating investments are started by the choice of the acquirer, and therefore they are not obligatory, making them essentially real options. To include this real options aspect into analysis of acquisition targets is one interesting issue that has been studied lately.
