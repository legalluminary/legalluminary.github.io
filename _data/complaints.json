To summarize, BSI has debited my account three times for {$2500.00} each time, and two of these are legitimate property tax payments, but the third is inexplicable. Therefore, BSI needs to credit me for their {$2500.00} error. However, instead of evaluating the information and reviewing the accounting, BSI keeps fabricating explanations and never provides documentation to support their fictitious claims, because there is no logical explanation for the debit other than an accounting error on BSIs part. \nBSIs most recent fabrication attempts to dismiss the problem by claiming that the extra debit was a back-payment for unpaid XX/XX/XXXX property tax. But BSI provides no supporting documentation to defend this claim. \nBelow, is my supporting documentation showing that BSIs claim of back-payment of taxes is clearly wrong. The taxes were paid in XX/XX/XXXX ( on time ) through my impounds held and paid by my mortgage service provider at that time : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. BSI was not even involved with my mortgage until XX/XX/XXXX after I had refinanced my home loan and the new loan was sold to BSI for mortgage servicing. \nMy series of documents below shows : 1. A copy of property tax bill indicating {$2500.00} amount due by XX/XX/XXXX ( would be delinquent after that date ) 2. Mortgage statement from my credit union ( which was the loan servicer at that time ) indicating a payment of {$2500.00} for property tax Bill 2 corresponding to the payment due in XX/XX/XXXX. \n3. Copy of property tax statement indicating that the payment was applied on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThese documents prove that BSI did not make a {$2500.00} payment toward XX/XX/XXXX taxes, since : 1. The taxes had already been paid on XX/XX/XXXX and were not delinquent 2. BSIs dollar amount does not match the tax amount due ( {$2500.00} vs {$2500.00} ), and the County will not accept tax payments that dont match the amount due 3. The property tax statement shows that payment was collected on XX/XX/XXXX which is ten months prior to when BSI claims to have sent a payment i.e. BSIs claim is patently false In addition, BSI has a history of mismanaging escrow/impound accounts as demonstrated by a {$200000.00} fine levied by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) in XXXX for severe escrow mismanagement. In fact, BSI is currently under a five year consent order associated with the XXXX penalty.

I have made my monthly payment of {$1200.00} every month since XX/XX/XXXX. The letter from the attorney stated my monthly payment had changed 5 times from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Having not received my monthly statements I was unaware of the monthly payment changes. My loan is a fixed rate and fixed term so principal and interest will never change. The amount applied to escrow would be more than sufficient to cover my home owner insurance and real estate taxes.

My attorney forwarded an authorization to send me statements and a copy of Order Permitting Secured Creditors in Individual Cases Under The Bankruptcy Code To Provide Debtors With Monthly Statements, Payment Coupons and Related Notices Without Violating The Automatic Stay.

They said something that it had to be over {$670.00} for it to be re-evaluated or something like that and my shortage was only {$620.00}. \n\nI was told that my request to have it reevaluated would likely be denied even though their error causes me additional hardship, and it's not accounted for the way it should be. \n\nI was told by XXXX at the company that the Insurer never notified them of the change with new premium but later XXXX at BSI Financial retracted that comment and said the insurer did send a new Declarations page the new amount of {$1900.00} but would not give the date they received. However, that still did not prompt them to correct my account they just said it would be an overage next year. \n\nMy renewal was XX/XX/XXXX but I made changes to my policy on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nMy premium went from {$2300.00} to {$1900.00} as a result of those changes. \n\nXXXX sent a copy of the declarations page to the mortgage company approximately XXXX the XXXX notifying them of these changes with the declarations page. \n\nThere was a refund check issued in amount of {$340.00} for difference in premium. It was issued by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I forwarded the refund payment to the mortgage company immediately after I received it as per my Insurance company instruction to do so. The Check # is XXXX issued on XX/XX/XXXX for {$340.00} BSI Financial had approximately 121 days from the time my insurer sent them the new declarations page showing the correct premium, but even after this amount of time they have failed to report it accurately. They seem to resist wanting to make this right, and do not care how these increased costs affect my family. \n\nIt is not fair to us to have to pay for something additional when it was not accounted for properly by BSI Financial. They had plenty of time to send a correct disclosure to me. \nI hope you can get them to change their stance on correcting their Escrow Disclosure because it was entirely their mistake.", "company_public_response": "", "company": "BSI Financial Holdings, Inc.", "state": "OK", "zip_code": "XXXXX", "tags": "", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "submitted_via": "Web", "date_sent_to_company": "2021-04-05",  "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "complaint_id": "4273798"},

At the time, they requested proof of insurance from us and my husband submitted it through the website XXXX, per BSIs request. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a collection call from BSI and since then I have spoken with numerous people in order to understand what they did to our account and make sure they correct their mistakes. Unfortunately, bringing customers accounts into default seems to be common place at BSI and I can only imagine how many customers have been victims of their unethical practices. I report our case below in details in hopes that you can help us by making sure BSI corrects their mistakes once and for all. \n\n\nHistory : Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX I received a collection call from BSI.  XXXX told me that they havent received payment for the last two months and wanted to know when to expect payment. I immediately checked my bank account and confirmed all payments have been sent on time, as usual ( we have autopay with XXXX XXXX XXXX ).  She then did some research and told me the reason the account was late was because the payments were lower than the amount owed and had been withheld. I asked why the amount had changed since we have a 30-year fixed mortgage and the amount should not have changed. She researched a little more and found out that BSI has paid insurance out of our escrow and that was the reason for changing our payment amount. I asked why they have paid insurance because we do not use our escrow account and have always paid our insurance and property taxes ourselves. She then  confirmed that it is true that we have paid XXXX. She said she was new and couldnt make the corrections, but a teller would call me back. \n\nMonday, XX/XX/XXXX Nobody called me to follow up on the corrections, so I called customer service to check the status of our account. XXXX was very helpful and explained that we needed to submit proof of insurance from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX in order to solve the problem, as BSI started withholding our  payments after they had paid ( duplicated ) insurance out of our escrow account. I told her we have submitted proof of insurance at the time, but I would send it again. \n\nPer BSIs request, I emailed XXXX proof of all 4 years of insurance the same day. \n\nTuesday, XX/XX/XXXX I received another collection call from BSI,  this time from XXXX. I explained the situation to her and she told me that no matter what I was behind one month on payments. She  asked if I wanted her to send me the payments history and I told her I needed BSI to correct their mistakes and bring our account current, as we have never missed any payments. I also told her I did not want to receive any more collection calls and wanted a confirmation when BSI has corrected their mistake and brought our account current, as it should be. \n\nWednesday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, BSIs Insurance Specialist, contacted Travelers asking for proof of insurance, even though I have already submitted proof to Customer Services on  XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nThursday, XX/XX/XXXX I emailed XXXX and informed her I have already emailed proof to BSIs Customer Care and asked them to forward it to her. \n\nFriday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX confirmed she received my file and was working on it. \n\nMonday, XX/XX/XXXX I emailed XXXX asking the status of our account. She replied right away saying she was in the process of fixing the account. She said she had received approval to remove the Force Place Insurance ( FPI ) and to refund all late fees. She also said it could take up to 5 days for me to see it on my end. XXXX was extremely helpful and reassured me she would make sure everything was correct in the end. \n\nWednesday, XX/XX/XXXX I asked XXXX if she was in communication with XXXX XXXX, from their Loss Mitigation Department, as I have received another letter from her talking about options to foreclosure. \n\nFriday, XX/XX/XXXX I followed up with XXXX because she didnt answer my last message and I needed to make sure XXXX XXXX was aware of BSIs mistakes and knew XXXX XXXX was making the necessary corrections. XX/XX/XXXX was the date BSI said they would declare all outstanding amounts under the Note immediately due if we havent cured the default by then. They were asking us to pay {$8800.00} in order to bring our account current, even though we have never missed any payments. \n\nXXXX replied to me the same day saying that currently our loan was showing due for XX/XX/XXXX. She explained there was a freeze on the account, so all the corrections could be made and that the freeze would be taken off when everything was complete. She ended saying she has done everything she could do on her end and she would send XXXX all her findings after she could see the full update on Monday, as they were still implementing changes to the account at the time. \n\nSaturday, XX/XX/XXXX I received another collection call from BSI, this time from XXXX. I explained the situation again and he said he was putting a hold on collection calls for a month in hopes BSI has corrected our account by then. \n\nThursday, XX/XX/XXXX I called customer services to talk to XXXX, as she was the person assigned to be our contact, but they said she only helps customers who need help with getting credit. So, I spoke to XXXX and had to explain the whole situation once more. XXXX said the problem was that we made an extra payment on XX/XX/XXXX and this payment was applied to principal only. I told her the problem in our account was due to BSI mistakenly debiting our escrow for insurance and said this supposedly had already been corrected. She confirmed the insurance issue had been corrected, but when I said I havent made extra payments, she said she was looking at the wrong account ( which she wasnt ). She then said that we sent our XXXX payment late on XX/XX/XXXX. I explained this payment was XXXX, not XXXX, as XXXX XXXX XXXX always send our payments either on the XXXX of the month or the last business day of the month when the XXXX falls on a weekend or holiday. She then requested a research and said it would last 3 business days. I was told I could call on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, to get an update. \n\nFriday, XX/XX/XXXX I emailed BSI giving them an ultimatum and asking to be assigned a point person, so I dont have to explain myself again every time I call them. Even though I wrote URGENT on the email subject, nobody contacted me. In fact, I have never received answers to any of the three emails I sent them and the only calls they make are collection calls. \n\nWednesday, XX/XX/XXXX I called customer services again and, luckily, I was able to talk to XXXX, the first customer service agent I spoke to, the first time I called BSI on XX/XX/XXXX. She was not able to transfer me to a Supervisor, as I requested at the beginning of the call, but she was very helpful and was able to ask them to void an escrow check they issued by mistake in the process of removing the FPI from our escrow account. ( I knew it was a mistake to issue me a check instead of crediting our escrow account, so I didnt cash the check. ) XXXX also requested the correction of XXXX payment that has been wrongly processed as an extra payment and applied to principal only ( the same thing XXXX had mentioned, except she then said she was looking at the wrong account ). XXXX gave me her extension number, so I wouldnt have to repeat myself every time I call and also said she would let me know as soon as the XXXX payment was corrected XXXX they needed to credit back the {$44.00} that was sent to me via check in order to be able to apply the payment ). The supervisor that couldnt talk to me, but was communicating with XXXX in real time, told her the problem would be solved within 24 48 hours. I told XXXX that my husband and I learned today that BSI has ruined our credit score ( It went from  XXXX to XXXX ) and I needed BSI to contact the Credit Bureaus and correct their mistake urgently. \n\nFriday, XX/XX/XXXX After leaving multiple voice messages to XXXX, I called customer services to confirm if BSI had credited the {$44.00} to our account and applied the XXXX payment correctly. I asked to talk to a supervisor and supervisor XXXX assured me all the corrections were being finalized and once the account was brought up to date, BSI would be able to send letters to the Credit Bureaus explaining we were reported late and delinquent in error.  She estimated it to happen on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, due to the XXXX XXXX holiday. \n\nTuesday, XX/XX/XXXX I talked to supervisor XXXX again and she confirmed that all corrections were made and the credit letters were sent to the Credit Bureaus. I thought that BSI had finally fixed all their mistakes at this point. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I asked if the XXXX payment had been applied and she said it hadnt, probably due to post office delays. I checked with XXXX  XXXX XXXX the same day and they confirmed they had mailed a check to BSI on  XX/XX/XXXX. I emailed customer care to let XXXX know about it. \n\nMonday, XX/XX/XXXX I called customer service to confirm if the XXXX payment has been applied on time because the XXXX statement that I received was still showing XXXX as unpaid. I spoke with XXXX, who was very helpful, and he said the XXXX payment was applied on XX/XX/XXXX. I then asked him to explain a fee of {$34.00} charged to my account. I noticed that they charged our escrow account after all the corrections have been made and there was a negative balance of {$22.00} that I requested to be removed from the account. XXXX disputed the remaining {$12.00} and couldnt explain exactly what they were for, but said it was related to late payments. The statement listed it as a property inspection fee, even though my property has never been inspected. XXXX said that disputes take up to 5 business days to be resolved and he would get back to me. He assured me that the XXXX payment would be applied on time regardless of the fees, as I specifically asked about it. Now that our credit scores have been restored, the last thing I need is for BSI to withhold our payments  again and wrongly report us late. \n\nTuesday, XX/XX/XXXX Because Ive never received any calls to confirm that the charges have been removed from my account and the XXXX payment has been applied on time, I called customer service ( again! ). This time, I talked to XXXX. She said the escrow balance was XXXX, so the {$22.00} fee had been removed, but said the {$12.00} fee dispute was not resolved yet. She confirmed that the XXXX payment would be applied on time regardless of the fee. \n\nFriday, XX/XX/XXXX I called BSI at XXXX XXXX  and, after being on hold for 10 minutes, I was redirected to a voicemail. I left a message.\n\nTuesday, XX/XX/XXXX I called BSI at XXXX XXXX  and requested a call back through their system, as they said the waiting period was 10 minutes. I called back one more time at XXXX XXXX  ( past the expected waiting time I was given of 10 minutes ), but was unable to talk to anyone again. I left a voicemail saying I would report BSI if I didnt receive a call back the same day. \n\nAt XXXX XXXX, XXXX returned my call. She said the {$12.00} fee had been removed from my account, so I decided to ask her if the XXXX balance was {$2800.00} ( my 30-year fixed mortgage  payment amount ). She said yes. I then asked if there were any fees charged to my account and she said there was a late fee of $ XXXX. I told her the charges had to be removed. Her supervisor didnt talk to me directly, but told XXXX that the charges were made in error and would be removed. The call ended at XXXX XXXX  ( I was on hold for very long periods of time during the call and it lasted 30 minutes ). \n\nWednesday, XX/XX/XXXX I called BSI customer services at XXXX XXXX  because I received the XXXX statement and the late fee of {$56.00} ( {$22.00} Escrow + {$34.00} Late charges ) were still showing. The call once more went to a voicemail and I left a message. \n\nThursday, XX/XX/XXXX I tried to call BSI again at XXXX XXXX, as nobody returned my call. After 10 minutes of wait, it went to a voicemail again. I left a message. \n\nFriday, XX/XX/XXXX BSI called me back at XXXX XXXX  and left a voicemail. I called again at XXXX XXXX  and requested a call back. I finally received a call back at XXXX XXXX. I spoke to XXXX ( the first customer service agent who called me on XX/XX/XXXX saying our account was 2 months late ). I realized it has been almost 3 months since this nightmare has started and it is hard to believe it is still not over. \n\nI explained to her that I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that the {$56.00} charges would be removed, but they were still showing in the XXXX statement and I was not sure if maybe the statement was issued prior to the correction. She said the charges have not been removed and couldnt be removed because they were late charges. She even mentioned the {$12.00} inspection fee again and at this point I said I wanted to talk to supervisor XXXX, as I have already talked to her a couple of times and she knew my case. After being on hold for a while, I was asked to leave XXXX a voice message because she was in a meeting. I told XXXX that BSI never calls me back when they say they will and asked to talk to any supervisor. After being on hold again, she said XXXX was now available and could talk to me. XXXX said she was requesting a research and someone was calling me back on Monday to let me know the status. I told XXXX BSI never calls me back and asked why she couldnt call me herself, so she agreed to call me back on Monday and make sure the charges are removed from my account. I told her I have XXXX confidence on BSI and said I do not know how BSI can still be in business. I also said I do not think these are mistakes, but intentional charges to make money out of customers. It is unethical and having worked 10 years in corporate banking, I have never seen anything even remotely close to what BSI has  been doing, not only to our account, but to hundreds of accounts ( based on online reviews and complaints ). XXXX might be able to remove the {$56.00} fees erroneously charged to our account and call me back on Monday as promised, but it has been almost 3 months since I started talking to BSI and every time, I thought it was over, there was another mistake the next month. I do not have the time or energy to be checking my statement every single month to make sure BSI didnt charge any fees to my account and applied my payment on time. I have a 30-year fixed mortgage with autopay, I do pay for insurance and property taxes on my own, and I have never  been late. Therefore, my loan should ALWAYS be current! There should be absolutely no extra charges or late fees of any kind. I want BSI to stop charging improper fees and keep our account up to date, as it should be.\n\n*************************** In summary, BSI has debited our escrow account without permission to pay for insurance, even though we have always paid our insurance and property taxes directly. Because of this mistake, they added {$7.00} to our monthly  payments of {$2800.00} and started withholding our payments last XXXX because it was less than the total balance due of {$2800.00} ( {$2800.00} + {$7.00} ). They only applied XXXX payment when they received XXXX payment and kept doing that until XXXX, when they decided to apply the XXXX payment that we sent to principal only, making the account appear to be 60 days delinquent. BSIs Insurance Specialist XXXX XXXX started the process of removing the FPI from our escrow account, as well as all late charges after she received the proof that I submitted to Customer Care on XX/XX/XXXX. BSI then adjusted the way payments have been applied, so our account could finally be current. Once this process was finalized, BSI sent letters to the Credit Bureaus stating their errors in order to restore our credit, as we were never late sending payments and we were certainly not 60 days delinquent. Unfortunately, they did not stop the charges to our escrow account and have added other charges after they have finalized all the corrections on XX/XX/XXXX. This whole situation is unacceptable and any ethical company would be embarrassed and would have done something to compensate us from all the stress, time, and energy this whole mess has cost us. Instead, BSI keeps charging our account, never calls us back as promised, and lately it has been impossible to get through customer service. \n\nWe have always had excellent credit and have never made any late payments to anyone. BSI reported us late multiple times, which ruined our credit scores. If that was not enough, we had to deal with the stress of receiving constant collection calls and a Notice of Default and Intention to Accelerate, even though we have never missed a payment. Our insurance broker has helped many of his customers facing similar problems with BSI, where they claim to have paid insurance on behalf of the customer, but can not provide any policy of such insurance. They have also charged customers for appraisals that were never performed. After talking to our insurance broker, Ive searched online and realized BSI has innumerous one-star reviews with Consumer Affairs and hundreds of complaints with CFPB. I tried to resolve the issue directly with BSI for almost 3 months, but I can not wait any longer. I need them to correct all their mistakes and never charge our account again for any improper fees.

Our review shows all of the balances as accurate, and no amended/adjusted PO quote will be done/provided. If you intend to pay off your loan, the amount we sent is what is due. '' XXXX XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, I called BSI Financial Services requesting assistance with the escrow balance on my PayOff statement and no one was able to provide me with an understanding or a statement of what was paid with the {$12000.00}. escrow balance, or explain why this balance was owed if my mortgage was current prior to the sale of the home on XX/XX/XXXX. \nXXXX XX/XX/XXXX settlement was made and the house was sold. I paid the {$12000.00} escrow balance at closing and continued to dispute with BSIXXXX XXXX  XXXX that this was incorrect and I was owed a refund for the overpayment at closing.

I need to know exactly what was paid besides the homeowners insurance and how you arrived to the escrow balance on the payoff. I have requested this information several times from customer service and again from you. The transaction history statement I received from BSI does not specify which amounts were allocated to taxes and insurance. \nThe PAHAF ( {$13000.00} ) grant paid mortgage, tax, insurance payments from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. The amount paid was the agreed amount to bring my mortgage current. It is extremely important that I also have a clear understanding of what exactly the grant funds covered as they requested and paid the exact amount that would pay to bring my mortgage current. Again, the documents I received from BSI/XXXX Mortgage group are not helpful and do not explain which of the escrowed payments applied to taxes and insurance.

Unfortunately, we do not receive receipts from the tax office. We use the payment history screen from their website to verify and validate payments due and payments received. Going through the payments made, there were taxes due, and we made the payment, which arrived at the Delaware County Tax Claim Bureau on XX/XX/XXXX. The tracking # for this payment is XXXX. The taxes paid were for XXXX and XXXX for parcel # XXXX and Parcel # XXXX. \nWe did further research, and it seems that our tax vendor did not set the tax lines up accurately when the loan was boarded into our system. We were able to verify that there were some issues with 2 parcels having the taxes paid timely ( this loan had 9 tax lines reflecting 3 identical parcel # s ) This has since then been corrected and updated. Because we were being charged penalties and now that this oversight was discovered our vendor has since then reimbursed us for the penalties incurred and paid by BSI. \n-On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX stating, \" Attached is a payment history for your account reflecting the application of HAF funds effective XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$13000.00}.

But this is simply not true. \n\nThe XX/XX/XXXX taxes were paid by my prior lender ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), and the dollar amount was {$2500.00} - this occurred 5 months before I even had a business relationship with BSI ( which began after I refinanced my loan in XX/XX/XXXX which was then sold to BSI financial ). \n\nAs further proof, attached is an image of the closing documents from that close of escrow/refinancing in XX/XX/XXXX- clearly showing ( see pen location ) that at close of escrow the XX/XX/XXXX taxes had already been paid, and that the next tax payment was due in XX/XX/XXXX ( which BSI paid delinquent in XXXX ). \n\nIn addition, I met in-person with XXXX XXXX tax assessor 's office ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and received a subsequent email from her review of the last XXXX tax payments ( attached ) where she explicitly states that the XX/XX/XXXX payment was made by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX not BSI! XXXX XXXX also clarified that the \" extra check of {$2500.00} '' from BSI was not needed and therefore photocopied and destroyed by her office. Her email includes the check numbers from BSI 's checks so that BSI can confirm that the check was never cleared/cashed. XXXX XXXX was even so generous as to offer to speak with BSI to help clarify the situation. \n\nHowever, BSI is choosing to ignore all of this supporting documentation and stick with their misinformed and inaccurate response.", "company_public_response": "", "company": "BSI Financial Holdings, Inc.", "state": "CA", "zip_code": "92009", "tags": "", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "submitted_via": "Web", "date_sent_to_company": "2022-07-25",  "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "complaint_id": "5808776"},

This is called fraud and why XXXX is under fire for not handling loans correctly and falsifying documents. Also my income proved I could make payments. So I sent the appeal to you and requested a new packet. I did not receive anything back from XXXX or XXXX regarding the appeal letter or new modification.

XXXX was very insensitive and I continued calling seeking assistance and leaving messages. I finally made contact with a lady and again reiterated my situation. She stated oh your escrow payment is very high. She said let me talk to my boss and see if we can stretch the escrow payment over a longer period.

I asked her if the loan modification did n't come through will your boss 's offer still be available and she pretty much said no. I never received any loan modification paperwork from BSI Financial. I went to a non-profit organization for help getting a loan modification with BSI in XXXX. In XXXX BSI Financial denied the loan modification stating my gross income states I can afford the payment and recommended I bring the account current, of which I 'm still 2 months behind. I called BSI representative XXXX XXXX about the denial and over avenues I can take to get help. XXXX was very short and stated I owed school taxes and that 's why my escrow is {$2000.00} short.

XXXX said well our strategy is that you bring the A/C current and we 'll look into possibly giving you {$1500.00}.

I got a call from a XXXX XXXX with BSI Financial around that time where he introduced himself and welcome me to XXXX and informed me that my loan was brought by his company. Then his next sentence was to tell me that I need to do a short sell on my home and that BSI Financial would give me a loan modification. He even said that I should of had known that this day was coming. So I said to him, wow you welcome me to your company and you are putting me out of my home all at the same time. So, I said this is a lot to take in. I asked him for his number and I told him that I would call him back tomorrow. I did n't have to call him back, because he started harassing me and calling me several times a day telling me I need to do a short sell. So I contacted the White House and wrote a letter to the President concerning this matter and I also got a third party representative, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from the HIP Program and the harassing phone calls stopped. Now fast forward to my recent issued with BSI Financial. The reason I say they are giving me an unlawful HAMP Teir 2 modification is because they never paid my all of my escrows for my mortgage. They only paid my property taxes back in XX/XX/XXXX but they did not pay my homeowner 's insurance and XXXX was included in my mortgage. BSI Financial never notified XXXX that they were not going to make a payment. XXXX XXXX of XXXX notified me in early XXXX that BSI Financial had not paid my homeowner 's insurance. He contacted BSI Financial and he was told that he needed to send the policy to another number. Then in the end of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX called to inform me again that BSI Financial did not pay my homeowner 's insurance. So I called BSI Financial and spoke with XXXX of their representatives were I was informed that BSI no longer paid homeowner 's insurance on \" these type of loans '' which was a direct quote from the representative. I ask her what did that mean and she could not tell me and kept repeating the same quote. So I asked her why BSI did not send me anything in writing to notify me of the changes. The BSI representative said that a letter was sent out to me in XX/XX/XXXX stating that they were only going to pay my taxes and not my homeowner 's insurance. I informed her that I never received that documentation and that I had received all of their correspondence in the past. So I asked her to send the letter out to me stating that BSI Financial is not going to pay my homeowner 's insurance, which they did by the end of XX/XX/XXXX. So around the XXXX week of XXXX I receive a letter from BSI Financial stating that they have given me a HAMP Teir 2 Home Modification and that starts XX/XX/XXXX I was so excited because I want to be able to afford my home but when I started reading the amount I notice that my mortgage went up from XXXX to XXXX and I have to pay this amount for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. This amount do not include my homeowner 's insurance which I had to pay myself and after the three month trial I will have a modification with BSI Financial and they will include my homeowner 's insurance. Now my new \" Monthly Mortgage Payment '' is a mystery because BSI Financial can not tell me how much my loan is going to go up after the three month trial period. And they say this is a HAMP Modification. I am not a professional when it comes to modifications but I do know that your payment is supposed to be lower so that you can afford your home and that it would not change after the three months trial period.

Upon finally receiving the details to contact my Account Manager directly, I confirmed on XX/XX/XXXX the wire details to transfer the additional principal balance ( $ XXXX ) which I completed on that day. This was to ensure the recast would be completed and reflected on my XXXX XXXX monthly payment ( reducing this by over {$990.00} so a significant amount ).

I have an XXXX loan on a condo I purchased XX/XX/XXXX. BSI is the \" loan servicer '' for my XXXX mortgage. I am current on my mortgage, and have never paid after the \" late fee '' date of any month since the loans inception. However every month beginning on the XXXX until well after my mortgage payments are mailed and received, a BSI \" in-house debt collector, '' continually phones me on a daily basis, at all hours, under the guise of a, \" courtesy call. '' BSI is a, \" debt collection service, '' as evidenced by their letterhead and all of its contents, and employees that are all too willing to identify themselves as such during their harassing phone calls. However, because they are also considered, \" administrators, '' of my mortgage loan this debt collection practice is considered legal, and I am harassed daily for payment on a loan, they themselves define as, \" not late. '' This legal loophole of, \" defining a debt collection agency as administrators of a mortgage loan, '' denies me and many others, the same consumer rights as allowed under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Federal RESPA rights guaranteed by a traditional mortgage lender. Although, they claim to offer me these services, I can provide evidence that they provide none of the services guaranteed by a state licensed and regulated mortgage lender and operate solely as a debt collection agency with no regards for anything other than circumventing the law and preying on hard-working, bill paying people. Furthermore, I believe my RESPA consumer rights were violated in that I was never notified of my rights when my loan was sold or transferred, and BSI has failed to provide me any loan services at all -- except to courtesy call me continually to ask for my payment. BSI alleges to have sent me a, \" Notice of assignment, sale or transfer of servicing rights, '' dated XX/XX/XXXX. I would like to respond that I have never seen that letter before. If I had, I would 've not only responded by submitting a, \" required verification of insurance, '' as instructed on page XXXX, but I also would 've sent a, \" qualified written request, '' to my loan servicer expressing my concern regarding my consumer rights.

This is proven by the fact that a plan was offered to sell the property to make the bank whole. The bank opposed the sale which would have happened within a 14-day period. They demanded the court that we seek a higher and better offer. When is it the business of the bank if they're paid in full to ask for anything more than what they're entitled to. They have done nothing but cause stress aggravation and defrauding the landowner of their rights under federal and state law.", "company_public_response": "", "company": "BSI Financial Holdings, Inc.", "state": "NY", "zip_code": "XXXXX", "tags": "Older American", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "submitted_via": "Web", "date_sent_to_company": "2022-05-31",  "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "complaint_id": "5613577"},

Soon after it was transferred to be serviced by BSI Financial Services in XXXX, XXXX with headquarters in XXXX, TX. When we first met with our mortgage broker ( XXXX, XXXX. ) we set a monthly maximum payment that we could afford which was {$1500.00}. Upon receiving our very first payment notice from BSI it showed a payment due of {$1200.00} which is what we've been paying for almost 3 years. On XX/XX/XXXX we received a Notice & Calculation of our new monthly payment of {$2700.00} ( due XX/XX/XXXX ) MORE THAN DOUBLE our original payment which the notice said was due to an Escrow Shortage of {$12000.00}! After initially researching on our own as to how this could even be possible we contacted & met with our original mortgage broker who did a conference call with us and BSI Financial on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. On that call we were told that for the entire time BSI took over our loan they were incorrectly taxing just our lot ( unimproved property ) and NOT including the house as our original mortgage banker had set up. We asked the BSI representative why we did not receive any type of correspondence until now as in looking back our escrow was already in arrears by {$6000.00}. a year ago. They failed to annually send a Truth-in-Lending disclosure as required by law. We asked the BSI representative, XXXX XXXX, why our loan was not correctly set up & serviced the way it was originally set up and her response was \" I don't have an answer for that. '' We also asked her \" and who's mistake is this? '' She replied \" it's our mistake. '' We have never had a late payment and even pay extra monthly to allow for possible yearly property tax increases. For the past almost 3 years, we have received our monthly payment notice from BSI and paid it accordingly. At no time did we receive any notice of a different payment amount due until a few weeks ago. We live on a fixed income and there is no way that we can afford a more than double mortgage payment due to BSI 's mistake! This could have easily been avoided by BSI properly servicing our loan the way it was intended & initially set up which is how most mortgages are financed, the lot AND the house. \n\nAfter researching online we found that this company has had thousands of complaints with the XXXX XXXX XXXX, so many that they stated they could only post 30 % of the complaints online. As you are probably aware we also found that CFPB settled with BSI Financial Services in a document dated XX/XX/XXXX for violating the Consumer Financial Protection Act of XXXX, the R/E Settlement Protection Act and/or the Truth in Lending Act by doing the exact same thing as in our case, specifically ..... \n\n*Handling mortgage servicing transfers with incomplete or inaccurate escrow information resulting in untimely escrow disbursements ; *Inadequately overseeing service providers, resulting in untimely escrow disbursements to pay borrowers property taxes & homeowners ' insurance premiums. \n\nWe are extremely upset and angry about this. While the BSI representative did not have an answer for why this happened & admitted it was their mistake the only thing they offered was for us to pay for their mistake by paying the {$12000.00} escrow shortage over 60 months which still raises our payment to {$1900.00} ~ {$700.00}. more that is not in our budget. \n\nWe are attaching copies of our original mortgage paperwork, closing disclosure, XXXX tax statements over the last few years.

My mortgage includes an escrow account which pays for private mortgage insurance ( PMI ), taxes, homeowners insurance, principal, and interest. My PMI payment is {$100.00}. This complaint pertains specifically to the PMI payment amount and the resulting effect on my monthly escrow payment requirements. In approximately XX/XX/XXXX, my mortgage was purchased by BSI. My due date for my mortgage payment with my prior servicer was on the first day of each month, which was to continue in such manner with BSI. By XX/XX/XXXX, the date for which my first payment was due, BSI had still not contacted me in any way. Based on a letter from my prior servicer, I knew BSI was my new servicer. I contacted BSI and inquired as to how I can make a timely payment since BSI had recently purchased my loan and had not made contact. No option to make the payment was provided. On XX/XX/XXXX, BSI had finally completed loading my data into its systems and advised that both the XX/XX/XXXX payment and XX/XX/XXXX payment were due on XX/XX/XXXX. No late fees were charged and this was acceptable. Consequently, I made this double payment on time. This is where the issue begins. Because BSI took so long to load my data into its systems, then first PMI payment that BSI made from my escrow account was on XX/XX/XXXX, for {$320.00} exactly XXXX times my normal payment of {$100.00}. This makes sense, as XXXX months worth of PMI was due at that point. I have no problem with this action. Shortly thereafter, BSI conducted an escrow review and determined, incorrectly, that I would have a significant escrow shortage based on the mistaken calculation that my monthly PMI payment was {$320.00} rather than {$100.00}. Consequently, my mortgage payment increased by {$260.00}, from {$2600.00} to {$2900.00}. Other than the PMI payment on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, all PMI payments made by XXXX, including each monthly payment subsequent to XX/XX/XXXX, have been for the correct amount of {$100.00}. Such payments were made by BSI on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I have not received my current statement so I can not advise on what date the XX/XX/XXXX payment was made. \n\nAs I did not realize this error until my payment amount changed on XX/XX/XXXX, I have contacted BSI via phone three times over the past approximately 30 days to seek resolution. The first call was on approximately XX/XX/XXXX, at which time a representative advised that she recognized the error and that it would be fixed. I called back about 10 days later and was advised that it was not reviewed yet, but that it would be escalated. I called back about another 10 days later and again was told that it would be escalated. To this date, BSI has not resolved the issue and I am going to make another erroneously-high payment tomorrow on XX/XX/XXXX. I have even explored refinancing so that I can be rid of BSI and XXXX go that route, although it includes up-front costs that I should not have to pay. This is a very, very simple problem that BSI should have already fixed. Instead, it appears that BSI will simply continue to require incorrect payment amounts indefinitely.

For such loans, they are eligible for MIP removal at 78 % LTV if in good standing after 5 years. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a substantial payment toward principal of the loan in order to achieve 78 % LTV. I noticed in early XXXX that they had not correctly applied this amount toward principal, but had left it as \" unapplied ''. I called customer service on XX/XX/XXXX in order to have this unapplied balance applied to the principal of the loan, and confirmed that the LTV would still be below 78 %. The customer service representative informed me that I needed to submit a request in writing to remove the MIP, which I did the same day. I have a copy of this letter available upon request. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that my loan servicer had still made a disbursement to MIP, so I called to understand why this had happened. The customer service employee informed me that the loan was not eligible because it is an FHA loan. I informed them of the XX/XX/XXXX changes to FHA MIP requirements ( available on the FHA website, top search result for \" FHA MIP '' ), and they said they would have to review the case and would call me back. I never received a call back. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed another disbursement to MIP, so called my loan servicer again. This was largely the same conversation as happened before. The person was confused, did not know what MIP was, but read from a chat conversation they were having with someone involved in PMI XXXX, describing the rules for PMI removal. I informed the individual of the distinction between PMI and MIP and the different rules that apply to FHA loans, and the different eligibility rules depending on when the case was originated. I was told I would receive a call back later in the evening ( Friday ) or on Monday. I never received a call back. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, another disbursement was made to MIP, and I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX from the PMI Processor, informing me that \" Your loan is an FHA loan and per FHA guidelines the premiums will not be removed until the Final MIP date is met. The Final MIP date is set directly by the FHA. Your loan shows the final MIP date as XX/XX/XXXX once the last MIP payment has been made the process to remove the FHA will be completed. '' This answer is an incorrect interpretation of the FHA MIP rules. On the letter, there is a call-back number for any questions or clarifications, which is the standard customer service number. \n\nI called today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and spoke with another customer service representative, having pretty much the exact conversations we have been having about MIP removal, but updated describing the various other times I have called and been promised calls back but not received them. This individual was able to get in touch with someone in regards to PMI processing, and delivered the same information as in the letter, that the loan is ineligible. I asked to escalate for further review and to speak with someone who would make the determination, because I believe the rules are not being interpreted correctly. The customer service representative requested what my source of information on the XX/XX/XXXX rule change was, and I directed them to the FHA website page. They said they were unable to get in touch with someone at this time who could discuss the details of my PMI, but that they would give me a call back. I asked how long it should take to get a determination and they said 24-48 hours. I told them I've heard that story too many times from them, and that I would like a direct callback number in order to resolve the issue in the case that they don't call me back in that amount of time. I was given the 1-800 number for customer service. I pressed about a direct number and was told none could be provided. \n\nThis is the most pressing issue among many others with this servicer. My loan was transferred to them in early XXXX, and immediately I noticed on their website how little information is available concerning the loan details and history. We made a change to our flood insurance coverage in XX/XX/XXXX and I emailed the new documents to the servicer, but never received any confirmation of receipt or changes that had been made. In fact, I've never received a single response to an email I've sent them in regards to anything, even an acknowledgement of receipt. The change in flood insurance significantly reduced our annual premium, so an escrow analysis should have occurred. I planned to request this if they did not initiate it themselves in short order after receiving the documents, but a further escrow analysis will be required for the MIP removal. I was assuming they would be resolved around the same time and I would save them the hassle of doing XXXX separate escrow analyses. In the XXXX call to customer service I did ask them to please check the insurance information to verify that they had the latest on file and did not require additional changes to the declarations page XXXX there had been issues when the servicer transfer occurred earlier in the year ). They confirmed that all of the information looked good and that they had the latest documents. However when I click to view details of the insurance payees and real estate tax payees on their site, those fields are blank. HUD is the only payee for which information is available. Overall the website is entirely lacking in transparency and the customer 's ability to manage the details of their loan and verify basic information. If the company 's answer is that you can always call customer service for any clarification of details, my experience is that those capabilities are similarly underwhelming.

Even though I am a XXXX ( for a XXXX XXXX company ) my hours got cut significantly and my wife was ( still is not ) working due to a work-related injury. We had gotten something in the mail from the mortgage company ( BSI Financial Services ) advertising forbearance as an option to help with the mortgage payments, so we gave BSI a call to get more information. The way it was explained to us was that we would not have to pay any monthly mortgage payments for a period, then after that period they would just tack it on to the end of the mortgage term. We figured since we were struggling a bit, it might ease up the load, so myself and step son ( borrower and co-borrower ) agreed to doing the forbearance. Five months later ( XX/XX/XXXX ), the forbearance ended and we received a letter stating the forbearance amount of over {$13000.00} was due in full by XX/XX/XXXX. We called BSI and got transferred from one person to another to another to another until we finally stated that we wanted to talk to a supervisor who then offered us a three-month extension on the forbearance and told us that at the end of the three months we could do a loan modification to have the forbearance amount put on to the back of the loan term, so we again agreed to do the forbearance. In XXXX, when the three-month forbearance was up, we called them to discuss the loan modification. We were told that someone will get back to us in 48 to 72 hours. We waited about a week before we called again. When we complained that no one called us back, the lady at BSI snapped at us and said that we weren't the only ones trying to get out of their forbearance and that there were thousands of people trying to do the same thing. She then said that someone will contact us in 48 to 72 hours. Again, we waited about one week before calling BSI again. This time ( on XX/XX/XXXX ), we asked to talk to a supervisor and stated that we would not wait anymore for someone to call us back. We were assured that the supervisor would call us back, so we agreed. She actually called us back within an hour. She eased out minds and stated that she would get us to a case manager that would get the loan modification process started and gave us her email so we could communicate that way with her should we have issues in the future. That same day the case manager called us and got all the information she needed from us to begin the loan modification process. After not hearing from our case manager for a few weeks ( even after repeated calls and messages being left, we called her supervisor to find out what was going on. She stated that she would get in touch with our case manager. Our case manager then emailed us on XX/XX/XXXX, stating that she had started a title search on the property and that XXXX would email us regarding the title order. She also said that this whole process could take 30 to 60 days and asked us to be patient. On XX/XX/XXXX, our case manager emailed us stating that the title came back clear and that she was now just waiting on taxes and escrow so she could submit to the underwriters. We gave it a couple of weeks before we attempted to contact our case manager again, multiple times, with no response. We finally contacted her supervisor again on XX/XX/XXXX, and found out that our case manager was no longer with the company and she never submitted a request to the underwriter 's review for the loan modification. The supervisor then told us that she was now giving us another case manager that would take care of things and apologized for this happening. She stated that all the necessary documents would be forwarded to the underwriters by the end of that week. We gave it two weeks then called our new case manager multiple times without any response. We, again, called the supervisor who apologized again and stated that she would get us to a new case manager. On XX/XX/XXXX, we spoke with our new case manager who assured us that we would get this process over soon. On XX/XX/XXXX, we were presented with three loan options and we chose one. Our new case manager was very responsive to our emails that week, then nothing. We gave it about two weeks ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and asked if there was any update. He responded the same day stating that it appeared that there was a delay with the title report.

My lender, BSI Financial Services had recently lowered my mortgage amount based on the property tax bill for XXXX, which was significantly lower than what my actual bill would be for XXXX. I have a new build, so I'm assuming I paid taxes on the lot, only. I was concerned that I wouldn't have enough in escrow to cover property taxes, so I asked for a re-evaluation of my escrow. I was told it would take no more than 30 days. \nThe 30-day mark had passed when I contacted BSI for a status update on my re-evaluation. I was told that an email would be sent to the \" Research Team '' and marked urgent and someone from that team would be contacting me via email with an update within 3-5 days. No one responded to me. Taxes were due XXXX and had not been paid, but weren't yet late. I called again to ask for an update and clarification regarding the re-eval and again, was told that another email would be sent and marked urgent, to the Research Team. The rep also offered to have someone contact me within 48 hours. No one called or emailed. I called several times and sent over tax documents to their customer care address. No one ever replied with confirmation that they were received. \nThe only way I could somewhat confirm any activity in escrow was through the customer portal, online. That same portal offers an \" Email Now '' option which I used to try to get someone to reach out to me regarding my concerns. In it, I explained that I'd reached out several times asking for updates and clarification about my accounts and instead, received the runaround. The response I received on XX/XX/XXXX was, \" We are currently processing your request. '' In XXXX, I received an escrow refund check for {$5300.00}, from BSI. After waiting a few days, I cashed it and paid bills once funds were available. The following Monday, my bank notified me that my account was overdrawn by {$3300.00}. BSI had stopped payment on that check resulting in wiping out what I had saved. \nThere was no documentation included with that check that indicated it should not be cashed. It was issued on XX/XX/XXXX, well after my escrow re-eval would've been completed. No one called me to discuss the conclusion of the re-evaluation or to tell me it was completed. No one contacted me regarding my options regarding a refund. \nLike most people with thousands of dollars in insufficient funds, I had to resort to desperate measures to cover pending transactions, which put me in more debt. Again, using the portal on XX/XX/XXXX, I expressed my frustration and disappointment with BSI, letting them know the financial distress they've put me in. I haven't received a response to that message. However, strangely, I did receive an email with an Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement attached with a message that read, \" Pursuant to your request, please see the attached document. Please note, this is not a monitored email account. If you have any questions regarding this email, please reach out to customer care. '' I never asked for a document. Interestingly enough, my original email was not included in this reply. I don't have any way of retrieving my own outgoing copy. The email to customer care is one I've used before as mentioned earlier but never received a response. \nI have been asking this company for months to clarify the nature of my account to avoid this very issue.

The first in XXXX involved BSI Financial not sending monthly statements or notification of payment changes to either me or my bankruptcy attorney for the first 6 months after the loan was transferred from the previous lender. BSI Financial acknowledged a system problem and corrected the issue. Unfortunately having not been notified of a payment change or receiving any mortgage statements my loan became delinquent unbeknownst to me when I was paying the lower monthly amount instead of the escrow adjusted amount. I eventually resolved this issue. \nIn XXXX I was forced to file another complaint against BSI Financial. BSI Financial for several years was purchasing lender placed insurance even though I provided them my insurance information. In XXXX they actually purchased 2 policies. On XX/XX/XXXX they purchased a policy costing {$2000.00} and a subsequent policy for {$2300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX even though I had a policy with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. To put it into perspective my annual premium at XXXX XXXX XXXX cost me {$730.00} in XXXX. In addition I never received notification of such purchases nor a declaration page from the insurance company. To this date I still do not know who underwrote these policies. These misappropriations of escrow monies and purchases by BSI Financial caused severe escrow shortages. BSI Financial resolved this issue nearly 2 years later on XX/XX/XXXX. \nThis complaint I am filing now has produced the most damage to me and my family. BSI Financial transferred incorrect data to the new mortgage company XXXX XXXX XXXX My final statement dated XX/XX/XXXX from BSI Financial showed a balance owed of {$4900.00}. I was also owed a credit of {$590.00} in unapplied payments so my actual balance was {$4300.00} ( a copy of this statement is provided ). After receiving my first statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX it reflected a balance owed of {$18000.00} which equates to a {$14000.00} difference XXXX a copy of this statement is provided ). This balance was based on information provided from BSI Financial to XXXX XXXX XXXX according to my account manager XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I immediately contacted both BSI Financial and XXXX XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX from BSI Financial and sent her a copy of the XXXX XXXX XXXX statement via her email. She said she would get back to me but has not responded yet. A subsequent phone call on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX at BSI Financial resulted in no call backs either. Please note that my attorney XXXX XXXX did send BSI Financial in XX/XX/XXXX a letter of authorization to speak, call back and/or provide statements to me so BSI Financial would not be out of compliance regarding lender restrictions in contacting borrowers in active bankruptcies.

We have paid this account IN FULL. We have repeatedly attempted to resolve this matter by telephone and have been regrettably unable to reach anyone who actually has a clue about what is going on with this account. We originally took out this loan in XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXX for the purchase of solar energy equipment that was to be installed on our home. This was accomplished and we began paying our monthly payments of {$210.00}. This payment consisted of Principal and Interest of {$190.00}, and Private Mortgage Insurance premiums of {$20.00}. It should be noted that we were not required to have any type of Escrow account because the lender on our first mortgage was already maintaining an escrow account for payment of property taxes and insurance. The original loan documents clearly state that no escrow account was necessary and that there was not a prepayment penalty should we elect to pay off the loan early. \nOver the years we have consistently paid extra amounts to reduce our principal balance. In XXXX, BSI Financial bought the loan. We made a number of extra principal payments in amounts up to {$3000.00}. So on the XX/XX/XXXX statement from BSI Financial, our principal balance was listed as {$11.00}. Our payment amount for XX/XX/XXXX was shown as $ XXXX.On the XX/XX/XXXX billing statement from BSI Financial , the outstanding principal balance was again listed as {$11.00}. Despite this, the billing statement showed a payment due of {$210.00}, the normal monthly amount. This included {$190.00} for principal, {$0.00} for interest, and {$20.00} for the PMI premium. We are at a complete loss as to how BSI Financial came up with a principal payment of {$190.00} when the statement clearly and unequivocally shows a remaining principal balance of $ XXXXThis baffling and disturbing series of events was repeated with the XX/XX/XXXX through current billing statements. The main difference was that these subsequent statements reflected a steadily increasing Overdue Payments balance consisting of the unwarranted payment demands from XX/XX/XXXX forward. At all times, the outstanding principal balance was listed as {$11.00}. In an attempt to reduce this outstanding principal balance of {$11.00}, payments of {$20.00} were remitted on XX/XX/XXXX and again on XX/XX/XXXX. BSI Financials records confirm that they did indeed receive both payments. However, instead of applying either of the payments to the remaining principal balance of {$11.00}, the payments were logged as unapplied partial payments and the amount of {$40.00} is sitting idle in our account. Instead of sitting idle, they should have applied to the outstanding principal balance of {$11.00}. This appears to be due to utter incompetence or as a means of preventing the outstanding principal balance from reaching {$0.00} as it should be. In summary, our account has been paid if full. A Qualified Written Request was sent to BSI Financial on XX/XX/XXXX. BSI Financial acknowledged receipt of the Request by letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. BSI Financial has since reported derogatory information to consumer credit reporting agencies. BSI Financial has refused to retract and correct the information to reflect our true payment history of entirely satisfactory and timely payments. The XXXX Tax Statement shows a balance of {$92.00} on page 2 in the Pre-Payment Disclosure Statement with page 3 showing the payment history. BSI Financial is acting in bad faith and has yet to respond the Qualified Written Request. Furthermore, BSI Financial has now sent us Notice of Default and Intention to Foreclose. BSI Financial is trying to take our home over a loan that was paid in full. This seems to be in retribution and bad faith due to the company buying the loan from another lender in early XXXX for us to then quickly turn around and pay it in full, depriving them of any gains from their loan purchase.", "company_public_response": "", "company": "BSI Financial Holdings, Inc.", "state": "AZ", "zip_code": "85340", "tags": "Servicemember", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "submitted_via": "Web", "date_sent_to_company": "2022-02-13",  "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "complaint_id": "5215464"},

BSIs response is a deceptive attempt to XXXX-wash its predatory practices. I respectfully ask CFPB to please continue reviewing my complaint against BSI and to investigate its mishandling of my home mortgage account. \n\nBSI Financial Inc is disingenuous in stating it has applied all funds to my account. In my initial complaint, I provided EXHIBIT H as proof BSI hadnt applied paid funds to my account. As further proof I am providing you with copies of their monthly statements which will also show BSI Financial had not been applying payments made to my account ( EXHIBIT AA ). \n\nBSI states my monthly mortgage payments {$730.00} is current. While my monthly payments are being paid on time, please do not be deceived, the monthly payment amount of {$730.00} only covers the monthly interest rate of the loan which is incorrect. My mortgage loan is not an interest only loan, but a 30-year fixed rate home mortgage loan. BSI is not collecting a monthly mortgage amount to cover the principal, interest, and escrow. Unbeknownst to me BSI has manipulated my loan to only collect interest and is withdrawing from my principal balance to fund the escrow account. Due to BSI Financials mismanagement of my Home Mortgage Loan they have only collected mortgage interest from me and the Illinois Hardest Hit Program, which means BSI has my principal balance in a negative amortization of over {$25000.00}. Please note this amount continues to grow as BSI has not corrected how it manages my home mortgage loan. \n\nIts important for me to point out, I asked BSI the reason my monthly mortgage amount was lowered, and never received a response. It was when I requested an account audit ( EXHIBIT BB ), I later learned BSI was only collecting monthly interest ( EXHIBIT H provided in initial complaint ). As a result, I emailed XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, to request my account be corrected ( EXHIBIT CC ). To date, I have not received an explanation nor has my account been corrected. \n\nBSI is cunningly refusing to address the negative amortization of my home mortgage loan, by stating it will address this in another complaint against them. Please understand, I notified the State of Illinois as the provisions of the Illinois Hardest Hit Program clearly state I will be in default of the forgivable loan and forced to repay the loan if it is in negative amortization. The provisions further state, I am required to report any changes that could affect the terms of the loan agreement. Its important for you to know I am a State of Illinois employee and my salary can be garnished or worse I could lose my job if I owe money to the state and local governments. To be forthcoming and hopefully avoid undue hardship, I reported the negative amortization to the State of Illinois, but I ask CFPB to please continue its investigation as I filed my complaint with you first. To date, I have not received a response from the State of Illinois regarding my complaint. \n\nKnow, my escrow account is incorrect as BSI is improperly withdrawing from my loans principal balance, to cover the monthly escrow payments. Without prior notification and explanation, BSI Financial has extracted a total of {$6100.00}, from my principal balance, and the outstanding principal balance has increased to {$150000.00}. These amounts continue to grow monthly as BSI has not corrected my account. More alarming, each month BSI Financial extracts an additional {$0.00} cents from the previous months principal balance transaction, this activity is a red flag of potential financial fraud. \n\nBSI is untruthful when it states it has reported correct information to the credit bureau ; it has not. BSI has falsely reported me as being 30 days late on my XX/XX/XXXX payment ; and being 120 days late on my mortgage payment for XX/XX/XXXX. As important, BSI failed to report actual payments made to the credit bureau and reported me as being delinquent. Note, the Illinois Hardest Hit made its payment to BSI Financial in XX/XX/XXXX ; payment received in the same month it was due is not 120 days late. Please refer to the attached copy of my credit report, which was referred to as EXHIBIT I in my initial complaint. \n\nIts important for me to bring to CFPBs attention, after my loan was reinstated in XX/XX/XXXX, BSI refused to communicate with me to inform me of my monthly mortgage payment amount. In fact, BSI placed a cease and desist on my account. I wrote BSI to learn of my monthly mortgage payment ( EXHIBIT CC ). Please know I didnt receive a monthly mortgage statement from XXXX XXXX until approximately XX/XX/XXXX ; and that mortgage payment was for XX/XX/XXXX ( EXHIBIT AA pg 6 ). XXXX XXXX XXXX of BSI verbally communicated to me the monthly mortgage amount I was required to pay for XX/XX/XXXX. I was also told XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX monthly payments were not owed. However, BSI now plays with these payments to clear itself of wrongdoing. \n\nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please dont hesitate to contact me at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am desperately seeking your help to restore my home mortgage account with BSI Financial and save my home. As important, I am certain I am not the only customers of BSI going through similar predatory practices.", "company_public_response": "", "company": "BSI Financial Holdings, Inc.", "state": "IL", "zip_code": "60621", "tags": "", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "submitted_via": "Web", "date_sent_to_company": "2020-07-09",  "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "complaint_id": "3723383"},

Regardless I kept up with my payments. I paid XXXX for this home. I found over charges of XXXX on orgination loan. In XX/XX/XXXX the value of home dropped to XXXX. So I was stuck and continued to make my payments. XXXX offered to modify the loan but because of drop in market and before they offered to modify the ARM they said I had to do a trial forbearance. During this time I was making all payments on time. Unfortunately the bank went under but the FDIC bailed them out and then spent 8 months going back and forth on modification because of the trial mod instead of being up front on how it worked they were reporting loan late every month and then told me the trial mod that I made all payments to they were requesting a lump sum payment of XXXX which was never stated and illegal. The FDIC approved mod but then I was given a bait and switch as they sold loan to XXXX. XXXX is where it got worse. To this day they owe me XXXX for not paying my escrow and over charges and putting force placed insurance on house when I had my own insurance and had to pay my own taxes as they were stealing from me. My taxes were not escrowed with XXXX and my home owners insurance was only XXXX per year and taxes under XXXX per year. XXXX was charging me XXXX for bogus forced placed insurance and XXXX for taxes and not once did they reimburse.

My mortgage company, BSI Financial, whom my mortgage was sold to has been causing continued harassment and grief. I am a single woman working to pay my house off and this company 's only mission seems to be to continue to make it more and more difficult to do this. I came to the end of a loan modification beginning 2015 and my mortgage became at an adjustable rate. I had been making payments of XXXX and now my payments are at XXXX a month. As this lump sum was difficult to make by the first of every month I called them and asked if we could break the payments into XXXX each month and was advised that this would not be a good idea, therefore I am only able to make the payments by the end of the month and keep in mind, each month I have and I have also attached a late fee with each payment. This is the only way that I have been able to make the payment in full each month. I, in the meantime continue to get harassing calls all month regardless of what I try to tell them about my financial situation. \n\nApproximately six months ago, BSI Financial calls and tells me my loan is going into foreclosure if I did n't come up with something like XXXX dollars, again, keep in mind I had been making my payment by the end of each month with the late fee attached and was up to date with my payments. When I called to inquire about this, I was told that the total of my checks had not been the correct amount and to be honest with you, the way that these bills read, I have not been able to determine what I owe each month. Therefore I simply look at the regular monthly payment on the bill with taxes and fees and add the late fee. \nRegardless of the fact that my check is there every month by the end of the month, BSI Financial is holding the check in the first week, sometimes two weeks into the month before cashing it and now, I learned that they are reporting to the credit bureaus that I have late payments on my mortgage. I have been trying of obtain a refinance on my home to get myself into a more affordable situation and not lose my home and not one bank will look at me because of this. \nAnother example : I had applied for a personal loan from a company who needed to see that my home was current on mortgage payments and when they looked into it, BSI Financial was appearing online as my house being paid in full. When I call to ask about it, the response was oh, that was our mistake, we will take care of it right away. \nCurrently, I just received a statement claiming I now owe XXXX and my payment is current up to the end of XXXX 2015. I have made several attempts to contact BSI Financial and am put on forever hold to the point where I have to hang up. \nI have looked this company up on the XXXX site and they are not even XXXX members.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the monthly escrow of {$840.00} per month ( {$10000.00} for the year ). The actual escrow amount required was {$12000.00} or {$2300.00} more than the XX/XX/XXXX escrow I had paid. I received an Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement dated XX/XX/XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. ( see statements ) As you will note. I was given XXXX Escrow Payment Options. Option 1 was to pay {$4800.00} which is {$100.00} more than the escrow short amount for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. In addition, I was notified that if I paid the shortage amount, my total monthly mortgage payment would also increase by {$190.00} more per month ( {$2300.00} for the next 12 months beginning XX/XX/XXXX. ) Option XXXX was to pay part of the storage and have the rest of my mortgage payment divided evenly and added to my mortgage payment. Option XXXX was to do nothing and to have all of this shortage divided evenly among the next 12 months. If I elected Option XXXX or Option XXXX, the shortage amount was due before XX/XX/XXXX. I received my XX/XX/XXXX Mortgage Statement and it was {$600.00} more than in it had been in the last 12 months. ( see attachments of the statement date XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and statement date XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. This increase will result in BSI receiving {$7200.00} for an escrow shortage of {$4700.00} for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. As I attempted to follow their guidelines \" Determining the sufficiency of your escrow balance, if the anticipated low point balance ( XXXX ) is less than the required balance ( XXXX ), then you have an escrow shortage.Your escrow shortage is {$4800.00}. '' This explanation baffles me since the XXXX amount listed is higher than the XXXX amount. \n\nTo summarize, BSI is attempting to charge me {$27000.00} for the payment of $ XXXX-two years homeowner insurance and county tax. Year one escrow paid was {$840.00} XXXX {$10000.00}. Year two escrow to be paid is {$1400.00} X XXXX {$17000.00}. My monthly year 2 escrow SHOULD be XXXX per month VS {$1400.00} they are attempting to charge me per month. \n\nOn XXXX I contacted BSI Financial Services. I was transferred to XXXX different people. The last person I spoke with said my Annual Escrow Account would be reviewed and that I would be notified in writing within 5 business days. \n\nI have not received any correspondence or contact from BSI Financial Services. In order to pay my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage on time, I paid BSI Financial Services {$3800.00}. It is felt that this is an over payment and I do NOT want this extra amount of money to go toward a principal reduction. \n\nBSI Financial Services purchased my mortgage from XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. BSI did NOT pay my annual property taxes. XXXX County put a lien on my property and notified me that it would be sold for past taxes owed. After weeks dealing with BSI Financial Services, they paid the taxes and the penalty for their late payment. My credit rating took a major hit as a result of their incompetence. \n\nI have been treated very unfairly, unethically and unprofessionally by BSI Financial Services. There appears to be no recourse to pursue this matter further with BSI ; therefore, my last hope would be some sort of advocacy on my behalf ( short of me having to suffer the additional expense of hiring an attorney ). \n\nThanks in advance for your assistance in this matter.", "company_public_response": "Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law", "company": "Servis One, Inc., Titusville, PA Branch", "state": "GA", "zip_code": "XXXXX", "tags": "Older American", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "submitted_via": "Web", "date_sent_to_company": "2015-11-30",  "consumer_disputed": "No", "complaint_id": "1676420"},

We live rural and have mailbox thieves and my locking mailbox is on back order, but we rarely have anything of importance mailed to us for this reason. The nice lady at BSI told me that once they are done with the new analysis that there would be NO HOLDs on the overage check since it is the 2nd analysis being done and to expect the overage check to be sent about a week after the XXXX analysis. THIS WAS A LIE! I watched our account on the BSI website and seen the new overage check transaction be processed on XX/XX/XXXX.

I was overcharged by {$2500.00} and need to be reimbursed for this amount. As outlined in the text below, the likely cause for this accounting error was an extra check BSI sent to the tax office which was not needed, and for which the tax office did not make BSI aware that it was uncashed ( photocopied and destroyed ). BSI needs to confirm this with the tax office ( a direct point of contact is provided, so no need to wait on hold ), and then reimburse me for the {$2500.00} overcharge. Attached copies of property tax bills confirm that only two debits/payments of {$2500.00} were needed to satisfy the tax bill. \nBSIs prior response to CFPB complaint # XXXX is not accurate. It was impossible for the {$2500.00} payment in question to have been applied to the XX/XX/XXXX tax bill. \nTo help resolve this ongoing issue, I physically went to the tax assessors office to gather more information. The office was extremely helpful and provided a point of contact ( POC ) phone number and email for me and BSI to reach out to directly for additional clarifications ( see XXXX XXXX XXXX info below ) no longer having to wait in the hold queue. \nA follow up phone call and email with the POC ( please see the email included as an attachment to this complaint. It contains a clear representation of the tax payment history for this property ) revealed the following : The XX/XX/XXXX payment was made by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, not BSI. \nOnly 2 payments of {$2500.00} were needed to satisfy the tax bill, but 4 payments were sent by BSI for this amount. \nFor the tax period in question ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX fiscal tax year ) BSI sent 4 payments of {$2500.00} to the tax office between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Two of those payments ( highlighted in green rows ) were applied to satisfy the tax bill. The other two payments were not applied ( were not needed, since bill was satisfied with two payments ) Of the two unnecessary {$2500.00} payments, one was canceled by BSI ( BSI canceled the check ) The other remaining {$2500.00} payment was not cashed by the tax assessor it was photocopied for record keeping purposes and destroyed by the assessors office. No notification was sent from the tax office to BSI to make them aware of this destroyed, unnecessary check. \nThis is most likely the cause of confusion for BSI, since BSI was not made aware of the destroyed check by the tax office. \nTo bring this matter to a successful resolution, I ask BSI to : Speak directly with the tax office POC, XXXX XXXX XXXX, at the phone number below ( note that she is out of the office on Fridays ) to confirm that check # XXXX and # XXXX were not cashed. XXXX XXXX is also available by email XXXX XXXX XXXX Senior Treasurer-Tax Collector Specialist, Financial Division XXXX XXXX County Treasurer-Tax Collector 's Office XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX | XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX Phone : XXXX | Fax : XXXX | XXXX NOTE : DAY OFF-FRIDAY After BSI confirms with the tax office that the extra {$2500.00} payment was not needed, and never cashed, then BSI needs to reimburse me for the {$2500.00} associated with the erroneous check/payment that was debited from my impound account. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX Below are property tax bills for the XXXX tax period in question as well as the years prior and subsequent to this period.

Recently, I have had a rough last six months. It is no excuse for not getting back with you sooner and even if you are a priority, it is sometimes the little things in life like, oh lets say, keeping your husband alive where you push your focus on just living to the next day. I still cant wrap my mind around the incident. Back on XX/XX/2022, my husband and I decided to finish removing overgrowth around our back yard, which is far from our home. We had borrowed a small tractor with a metal bucket on the front. As we worked, it started to get hot and so are we. On this day, we were supposed to also sign a refi on our mortgage but even that situation didnt happen. What I remember on that day was that my husband of 44 years died in my arms. \nXXXX walked around trying to find somewhere to sit down and of course, he picks to sit down inside the metal buckets of the tractor. I took a drink of water and seen XXXX head was leaning back against the metal buckets. He was having a XXXX XXXX. The first thing I did was to say a prayer as I called XXXX. Thanking XXXX he was with me. \nXXXX was dead weight at this time. I couldnt lie him down because of the metal bucket that he was leaning into. So I asked XXXX, Dont let me panic, first of all. Fixing the phone where I would be able to talk with the XXXX operator, I then had to hold XXXX head up so that he could breath but he wasnt breathing. I listened and heard XXXX say, the breath will come through the stomach so without thinking I punch XXXX in the stomach. He took a deep breath. \nThen I heard, you love him. I knew that meant pump on his heart but he wasnt lying down. He was sitting up. You love him, I heard again. So my hand made a fist and started to pound on his heart. While thinking it has to be hard enough pressure to get to his heart, so how much do I love him. A lot! So I kept pounding until I heard his heart beat with my ear. He needs to wake up. So my hand went to his face and I started slapping him. \nAt this point, I said out loud to myself, Now I get to slap you. I did this repeatedly. Breath, love, and open your eyes. It seemed like hours. It wasnt but a minute or two, and XXXX was asking me why I was hitting him. He awoke as if he just fainted for a second. I knew better than that. He stood up and walked over and set on the back of the mower. The XXXX was finally coming. \nThose guys even brought the stretcher all the way back behind the-house. XXXX was speaking by now clearly to the XXXX. His XXXX XXXX was slightly elevated but nothing to be concerned about. They even mention that they thought that XXXX probably was dehydrated but my reaction was that it had to be much more. As the EMTS started the monitoring of XXXX heart beat, I noticed that they never said anything to XXXX or I, but they shared the sheet of paper among themselves and that XXXX shouldnt even walk to the gurney. XXXX stood up and walked to the gurney. \nThey immediately took him to the hospital. I had to wait for my granddaughter to get home from culinary school, so when we finally get to the hospital, XXXX was already in XXXX. The doctor told me he had a 100 % blockage where the blood was not pumping through his heart but behind his heart and that it took two stents instead of just one. Since it happened, it has been hard trying to get to the right doctors with the right medications. Its very daunting. We have been married for 44 years. We married when he was sixteen and I just turned 20. So being older you would think I would have the blockage but to lose someone so quickly. Blows your mind! I praise XXXX because he kept me going where I could have lost my love. Im blessed.\n\nHowever, two months later I get XXXX, my granddaughter gets XXXX, then my husband as well. I literally had it for a solid month. Everyone else only had it a week but not me. No, I had it a whole month not being able to breath through my nose or even to think straight. My nose was so sore and red as a beet. Finally, I started feeling better than death warmed over, so hopefully I can get this situation finalized. \nFirst, On XX/XX/2022, my husband had a XXXX XXXX, and it was also the day were supposed to refi with another mortgage loan. In process of getting the loan, the mortgage holder wanted an update on our mortgage. Therefore, before the loan was accepted and signed the insurance was increased to cover the aspected loan needed. However, because of my husbands XXXX XXXX, we were not able to sign the loan and once I had a chance to look over the loan we decided that the loan was not right for us. \nHowever, while we didnt sign for the loan the insurance was do in XX/XX/2022. While I worked to get the insurance back to the original amount, I believe BSI paid the increase in escrow. In addition, I called and had my insurance to send the mortgage BSI a copy of the corrected declaration page and the corrected amount. \nIn addition, our mortgage is paid through a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX where our payments are deducted from our checking account every two weeks. And we have not missed a payment. Our account number is # XXXX. Also, the way we pay, which is every two weeks a year. We pay an extra two payments a year. So why do I owe Two late payments? It start in XX/XX/2022, I received a statement on a extra payment was necessary To be made. Once again my payments are taking out by autopayplus and distributed to BSI. so how am I two payments late now, which is a total over {$3900.00} but with no explanation why. Now they have sent me a loss mitigation to file with them. I dont understand why the insurance has not been corrected and why and how do I owe more money. \n\n\nPlease let me know if this is good with you, so that we can resolve this issue quickly. This letter is to resolve the issue between BSI MORTGAGEand XXXX XXXX. You can contact me by email at XXXX anytime or by mail at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL.

Due to your failure to apply this payment to escrow, you then alleged that our XXXX payment was not made, since it did not include the increased monthly escrow amount you claimed was owed, despite having received our escrow shortage payment. In fact, our XXXX payment of {$2800.00} was made on XXXX XXXX, 2016. \nYou failed to acknowledge any receipt of this payment and alleged we failed to make any payment on our mortgage for XXXX 2016. I had repeated conversations with your account representatives and posted a message to your so called customer service department explaining your mistake and put you on notice that any reported delinquency to the credit agencies would be treated as a violation of the law. Your account representatives acknowledged your mistake and acknowledged that you had in fact received the proper payment and escrow shortage payment. Not surprisingly, however, you still proceeded to report to the credit agencies that we had failed to make our mortgage payment. \nTo further compound your knowing and intentional violations and despite repeated requests, you have failed to provide any accounting of our escrow account reflecting application of our escrow shortage payment of {$480.00} and have subsequently raised our mortgage payment almost {$50.00} per month to cover the \" escrow shortage ''.

Accordingly, if you do not within 10 days of the date of this letter ( i ) notify the credit agencies of your mistake and remove your negative report, ( ii ) provide us with a true and accurate escrow accounting, including application of our {$480.00} escrow shortage payment, and ( iii ) credit our account {$2500.00} for damages we have suffered to date due to your violations of state and federal law, we will proceed with filing our claims against you in the applicable court of law and seek recovery of our legal fees.

BSI claims that when they took over the loan in XXXX, the account was already two months in arrears and they only have payment through XXXX XXXX, making it perfectly legal for them to claim default. Again, I never received any correspondence suggesting that I owed more than I was paying.
